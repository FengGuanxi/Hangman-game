 DATE : 05.27.2013.

 This is a simple HANGMAN GAME that
 we all had played in childhood.


 Player 1 will give a word as input and Player 2 will guess the word
 by giving an alphabet as input.

 If Player 2 guesses it right then he/she is the winner
 Player 2 gets only 5 chances to guess the word

                           !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 But this program has some constrains :

 Constrains 1 : all inputs has to be alphabets in small case

 Constrains 2: Player 2 can not give any string as input it has to be a single word with no space or any special character.

 Constrains 3: the word can not be more than 100 characters long



                           !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy The Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
